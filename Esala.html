      <h3>A Journey Through Time</h3>

      <p>
        The origins of the Esala Perahera date back to the 3rd century BCE, a
        time when Buddhism took firm root in Sri Lanka. The festival
        commemorates the sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha, which is enshrined
        in the revered Dalada Maligawa, or the Temple of the Tooth, in Kandy.
        This relic holds immeasurable spiritual significance for Buddhists
        worldwide, making the Esala Perahera an event of profound religious
        importance.

        At the heart of the Esala Perahera is an awe-inspiring procession,
        resplendent with a stunning display of cultural heritage. The event
        spans over ten nights, each of which holds a unique significance.

        The first five nights, known as the "Kumbal Perahera," feature

        all paying homage to the sacred relic.

      <p>
        Following the Kumbal Perahera, the "Randoli Perahera" takes center
        stage. This phase elevates the grandeur, introducing more elephants,
        lavishly adorned in vibrant garments, and beautifully illuminated by
        countless lamps. The brilliance of the procession under the night sky
        leaves spectators spellbound.
