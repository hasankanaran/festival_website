      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most widely celebrated
        festivals in India and among Hindus worldwide. It holds deep cultural
        and spiritual significance, marking the triumph of light over darkness,
        good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. The festival spans over
        five days, each with its own rituals, traditions, and festive fervor.
      </p>

      <h2>Historical and Religious Significance</h2>

      <p>
        Diwali has its roots in ancient Indian mythology and is associated with
        various legends. One of the most prominent stories is the return of Lord
        Rama, his wife Sita, and brother Lakshmana to Ayodhya after defeating
        the demon king Ravana. The people of Ayodhya celebrated their return by
        lighting oil lamps, which is believed to be the origin of the tradition
        of lighting lamps during Diwali.
      </p>

      <h2>Celebrations and Customs</h2>

      <p>
        The festivities of Diwali are characterized by a vibrant display of
        lights, decorations, and cultural rituals. Homes and public places are
        adorned with colorful rangoli designs, lamps, and candles. Families come
        together to exchange gifts, share festive meals, and offer prayers to
        the goddess Lakshmi for prosperity and well-being.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Day 1: Dhanteras</h3>

      <p>
        Dhanteras marks the beginning of the Diwali celebrations. It is a day
        dedicated to the worship of Goddess Lakshmi and is associated with
        acquiring wealth and prosperity. People buy gold, silver, and utensils,
        and offer prayers for blessings.
      </p>

      <h3>Day 2: Choti Diwali (Narak Chaturdashi)</h3>

      <p>
        Choti Diwali is celebrated with fervor, symbolizing the victory of Lord
        Krishna over the demon Narakasura. It is customary to take an oil bath
        before dawn and light lamps to dispel darkness and ignorance.
      </p>

      <h3>Day 3: Diwali</h3>

      <p>
        The main day of Diwali is marked by elaborate prayers, feasts, and the
        lighting of lamps and firecrackers. Families gather for a special puja
        (prayer) to seek blessings for prosperity and happiness. It is also a
        time for cultural performances and sharing joy with loved ones.
      </p>

      <h3>Day 4: Govardhan Puja</h3>

      <p>
        Govardhan Puja is dedicated to Lord Krishna and commemorates his lifting
        of the Govardhan Hill to protect the people of Vrindavan from the wrath
        of Lord Indra. Devotees create symbolic mountains of food and offer
        prayers in gratitude.
      </p>

      <h3>Day 5: Bhai Dooj</h3>

      <p>
        Bhai Dooj celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters
        apply a tilak (vermilion mark) on their brothers' foreheads and perform
        aarti (ritual) to ensure their well-being. It is a day of love,
        blessings, and strengthening family ties.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Diwali is a festival that transcends borders, bringing people together
        in a celebration of light, love, and prosperity. It serves as a reminder
        of the triumph of good over evil and the importance of knowledge and
        compassion in our lives. The festival of Diwali continues to inspire
        hope and unity, radiating its brilliance far beyond the five days of
        festivities.
